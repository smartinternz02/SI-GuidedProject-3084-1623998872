Hello ,
Grocery Recommendation System For Retail Markets
This Guided Project focuses on building a system where cameras at entry recognize the customer and link his
previous purchase history stored in the database. Based on that purchase history he will get a recommendation 
of the offers on the product which he wishes to buy. And also displays on the screen at the entrance as soon as he steps into the store
